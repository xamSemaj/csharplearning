Each folder represents a topic or lesson. These are **console-based** projects focused on mastering core C# concepts such as:

- Variables & Data Types
- Loops & Conditionals
- Functions
- Classes & OOP
- Polymorphism Inheritance, Interfaces
- Exceptions and Error Handling
- LINQ
- .Net Under the Hood
- Advanced C# types
- Collections
- Project Assemblies and Solutions
- Strings 
- Numeric Types
- Events
- Unit Testing
- Clean Code
- Multithreading and Asynchrony 
- The Evolution of C#
